# Three Lessons Learned
- Always include docstrings, any class definitions or functions 
- List comprehensions make the code easier and simpler to read. Oftentimes there are simpler methods to doing things
- Reinforced the SRP rule. A function always does only ONE speciffic task, and its best if functions can be reused
